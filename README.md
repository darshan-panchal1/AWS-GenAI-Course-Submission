## Amazon SageMaker: Fine-tuning Llama2 Large Language Model

### Overview

This project involves fine-tuning the Llama2 Large Language Model using Amazon SageMaker, focusing on the financial domain. Here are the key steps and outcomes:

### 1) Pre-trained Model Evaluation

- **Notebook Instance Type Used:** `ml.t3.medium`
- **GPU Instance Used:** `ml.g5.2xlarge`

#### Steps:

1. **Deploy the Llama2 Model on AWS SageMaker:**
   - Use the pre-trained Llama2 Text Generation Large Language Model.

2. **Evaluate the Pre-trained Llama2 Model for Financial Domain Knowledge:**
   - Provide domain-specific input for evaluation.
     - **Input:** "The results are encouraging for aggressive investors"
   - **Model Response:** "For those who want to trade in the short term, the stock is currently trading at $31.40, which is 45.6% higher than the 52-week low of $21.67 and 66.4% higher than the 52-week high."

### 2) Fine-tuning a Large Language Model

- **Fine-tune a Large Language Model with a Financial Domain-Specific Dataset**

### 3) Evaluate the Fine-tuned Llama2 Large Language Model

- **Deploy the Fine-tuned Llama2 Model on AWS SageMaker**
- **Evaluate the Fine-tuned Llama2 Text Generation Large Language Model on Text Generation Tasks and Financial Domain Knowledge**

#### Steps:

1. **Domain-specific Input:**
   - "The results are encouraging for aggressive investors"

2. **Model Response:**
   - "The S&P 500 is up 14% this year, but it's not the only index that's outperforming. The S&P Midcap 400 is up 16% so far in 2019, and the S&P."
